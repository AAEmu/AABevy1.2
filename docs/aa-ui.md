# aa-ui: the X2 UI widget toolkit in Bevy

The ArcheAge 1.2 UI is Lua (the `.alb` bytecode under `scriptsbin/x2ui`) driving a native widget
toolkit inside `x2game.dll`. `crates/aa-ui` is that toolkit in Rust: the original scripts run
unchanged in Lua 5.1 (through `aa-lua`) and build the screens the way the client does; aa-ui
lays the widgets out, draws them with Bevy and feeds mouse and keyboard input back to the
scripts.

Status: world select, character select and the 2D layer of character create (all three steps,
every race and gender) run from the original scripts with no script errors. The layout tree matches the real client's capture
(`reference/*/ui.json`) by object path (class, offset, extent, visibility):

| screen | reference | match |
|---|---|---|
| world select, 0 / 1 characters, nothing / a row selected | `reference/world_select/ui*.json` | 51-53 of 51-53 |
| world select at 1600x900 | `reference/world_select/ui_1600x900.json` | 51 of 51 |
| character select, 0 / 1 characters | `reference/character_select/*/ui.json` | 53 of 53, 58 of 58 |
| character create step 1, 8 race/gender combinations | `reference/character_create/step1_*` | 48 of 49 each (*) |
| character create step 2, 8 race/gender combinations | `reference/character_create/step2_*` | 139 of 139 each |
| character create step 3, 8 race/gender combinations | `reference/character_create/step3_*` | 44 of 44 each |
| character create step 3, skillset picked and a name entered | `step3_nuian_male/ui_ability_name.json` | 52 of 52 |

(*) The one left is `step1.content.congestionTip_bg`, a drawable of a hidden tooltip that the
capture reports by its own visible flag; not drawn by either.

Pixels: the world select screenshot matches `reference/world_select/real.png` to 0 px in
geometry and text placement; the remaining difference (mean absolute error about 10 of 255) is
tone, see [Known differences](#known-differences). A static screen costs nothing per frame
(meshes are rebuilt only on change): 300-490 FPS at 1920x1080 on the dev machine, bound by
Bevy's frame overhead, not by the UI.

## Running the examples

```text
cargo run -p aa-ui --example world_select -- --shot shots/aa-ui/world_select.png
cargo run -p aa-ui --example character_select -- --shot shots/aa-ui/character_select.png
cargo run -p aa-ui --example character_create -- --shot shots/aa-ui/character_create.png
cargo run -p aa-ui --example character_create -- --race elf --gender female --step 2
```

All three run the screen's scripts with a fake game API (`examples/fake/`: 3 servers, one
character) and are interactive: hover and click the server list, the character list and the
buttons, type into edit boxes. FPS, quads and draw calls are logged every few seconds.

| flag | meaning |
|---|---|
| `--shot PATH`, `--shot-after S`, `--exit-after S`, `--size WxH` | from `aa-dev`: screenshot, quit, window size in physical pixels |
| `--worlds ref0\|ref1` | world list of the reference capture (one world, 0 / 1 characters) instead of 3 servers |
| `--characters 0\|1` | character select with no / one character |
| `--race nuian\|elf\|ferre\|hariharan`, `--gender male\|female`, `--step 1\|2\|3` | character create like the capture (button clicks, then `characterCreate:OnNextStep()`) |
| `--click X Y T`, `--hover X Y T` | scripted mouse (physical pixels) at T seconds, through [`UiVirtualPointer`](#app-integration) |
| `--lua CODE T` | run Lua at T seconds |
| `--type TEXT T`, `--key NAME T` | type into the focused edit box / press `enter`, `escape`, `backspace`, `delete`, `tab`, `left`, `right`, `home`, `end` |
| `--dump PATH`, `--dump-after S` | write the tree in the `reference/*/ui.json` format |
| `--coverage` | print the per-class native coverage table (below) |

Reference checks (tools in `data/extract/aa-ui/tools/`, not committed):
`check_all.sh` runs every reproducible capture and compares the dumps with
`cmp_tree.py <reference ui.json> <our dump>` (by object path: class, offset, extent,
visibility); `imgdiff.py` and `crops.py` compare screenshots.

### Objects

Every widget, drawable and text style is a plain Lua table, so scripts can add fields and
override methods per instance (`frame.InsertColumn = function ... end`), as they do. The id of
an object lives outside the table (a weak-keyed table maps table to id), so `pairs(widget)` sees
only script fields. The native methods are in one method table per class, reached through the
metatable's `__index`.

Each class's method table is exactly the client's (`lua/classes.rs`): natives we implement are
real, the others are logging stubs (they return nothing; `stub_calls()` counts them), and a
method the class does not have is absent. That matters: scripts test methods
(`if widget.SetChecked then`) and fields (`if self.bgs == nil`). `CreateChildWidget(type,
name, index, reflect)` creates the child and, when `reflect` is set, stores it on the parent
(`parent[name]` or `parent[name][index]`); `widget.style` / `titleStyle` are text style objects.

### Layout

Coordinates are UI units, origin top-left, y down; 1 unit is 1 pixel at UI scale 1.0, which the
client uses for both 1920x1080 and 1600x900 (0.85 below 1280x864). Widgets do not scale with
the resolution: they are anchored (`AddAnchor(point, target, relPoint, x, y)`, nine points),
and a widget with two anchors on opposite sides stretches. `tree.rs` resolves anchors to
rectangles lazily and caches them per tree generation.

Drawing order: top-level widgets by UI layer (`SetUILayer`: background, game, hud, normal,
dialog, tooltip, system), then creation / `Raise` order; children above their parent; inside a
widget the drawable layers background, artwork, then the widget's own text, then overlay.

### Rendering

`render::build_quads` walks the paint order and emits textured, vertex-coloured quads in
physical pixels; consecutive quads with the same texture share one mesh. Everything is rebuilt
only when the tree generation changes (any mutation bumps it) or the window is resized, so a
static screen costs no CPU per frame. Glyphs live in one 2048x2048 atlas (which also holds the
white texel for solid quads). Textures are the pak's DDS files, decoded by Bevy (DXT1, DXT5,
A8R8G8B8 so far).

Blending happens in gamma space (`UiConfig::gamma_blending`, `CompositingSpace::Srgb` on the
UI camera) like the client's Direct3D renderer: with linear blending the semi-transparent
panels come out visibly too light.

### Text

Fonts come from the pak through `fonts/fonts.g` (a primary font plus fallbacks for Unicode
ranges, per locale), rasterised with `swash` at integer sizes with hinting; advances are whole
pixels, so measured widths (`GetTextWidth`) and drawn text agree. Line height is the font's
ascent + descent rounded (yd_ygo540: 13 px -> 16, 15 -> 18, 18 -> 22), a text's height is
`n * lineHeight + (n - 1) * lineSpace`, and a trailing line break does not add a line, as in the
client. Inline codes: `|cAARRGGBB ... |r` colour; value codes `|,N;` (thousands separators),
`|mN;` (money with gold / silver / copper coin icons), `|bN;` (loyalty token icon).

### Handlers and events

`SetHandler(name, fn)` stores handlers per object; `RegisterEvent(name)` subscribes to a UI
event, delivered as `OnEvent(self, name, ...)`. Natives that fire handlers (`Select`,
`SetChecked`, `SelectTab`, ...) queue the call and run it once the native returns, so a handler
never runs inside a borrowed native. `UiRuntime::fire_event` raises an event now;
`queue_event` raises it at the next frame (use it for game API answers that the client gets
from the server later). Every frame `tick` advances fades (`Show(true, ms)`), fires
`OnEndFadeIn` / `OnEndFadeOut` and calls `OnUpdate(self, dtMs)` on visible widgets.

### Input

Mouse: the topmost widget under the cursor that takes the mouse (buttons, check buttons, edit
boxes, sliders, list boxes, or anything with a mouse handler) by layer and paint order; a
visible modal window (`SetWindowModal`) blocks everything outside it. It gets `OnEnter` /
`OnLeave`, `OnMouseDown` / `OnMouseUp`, `OnClick(self, "LeftButton" | "RightButton")` (on the
nearest ancestor with a handler, if enabled), `OnWheelUp` / `OnWheelDown`. Native behaviour:
button state art (normal / highlight / pushed / disabled), check buttons toggle before their
`OnClick` and fire `OnCheckChanged`, list rows with data highlight and select (`OnSelChanged`,
double clicks), tab buttons select their tab (`OnTabChanged`).

Keyboard: one widget has the focus (`SetFocus`, or a press on an edit box; `ClearFocus`, Escape
or a press elsewhere drops it; `OnAcceptFocus` on gain). Keys go to it: edit boxes insert typed
text at the caret (with `SetMaxTextLength`, `SetDigit`, `SetDigitMax`, `SetReadOnly`;
`SetPassword` shows `*`) and fire `OnTextChanged(self)`; Backspace, Delete, Left, Right, Home,
End edit and move the caret; Enter fires `OnEnterPressed` (multi-line boxes insert a line
break, `ClearTextOnEnter` empties the box), Escape `OnEscapePressed`, Tab `OnTabPressed`; every
key also fires `OnKeyDown` / `OnKeyUp(self, name)` with lower-case names (`"enter"`). `SetText`
does not fire `OnTextChanged` (the money edits call `SetText` from that handler). The caret
blinks every 530 ms.

## App integration

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

App::new()
    .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, aa_ui::UiPlugin::default()))
    .insert_resource(aa_ui::UiSetup::new(|ui| {
        // 1. game API objects (called while the scripts load)
        let x2world = aa_ui::lua::install_game_stub(&ui.lua, "X2World").unwrap();
        x2world
            .raw_set("GetWorldList", ui.lua.create_function(|lua, _: mlua::Value| {
                // ... a table of world infos from aa-net
                lua.create_table()
            }).unwrap())
            .unwrap();
        // 2. the screen's scripts in the client's order (init script, base contents, contents)
        ui.run_stage(aa_ui::Stage::WorldSelect);
        // 3. the events the client raises when it enters the stage
        ui.fire_event("ENTERED_WORLD_SELECT", ());
        ui.fire_event("SHOW_SERVER_SELECT_WINDOW", true);
    }))
    .run();
```

* `UiPlugin { config: Some(UiConfig { locale, camera_order, clear, gamma_blending }) }`. The UI
  draws with its own 2D camera (order 10 by default) over the 3D scene. Cameras that share the
  window's main texture must use the same `CompositingSpace`, or Bevy falls back to linear for
  all of them: give the 3D camera `CompositingSpace::Srgb` too, or set `gamma_blending: false`.
* `UiSetup` runs once, when the window size is known, with the new `UiRuntime`. The runtime is
  a Bevy non-send resource (`NonSendMut<UiRuntime>`); call it from systems for later events.
* Game API: `lua::install_game_stub(lua, "X2World")` registers a table where every method
  exists and returns nothing (logged once); replace methods by setting fields, from Rust
  (`create_function`) or Lua (`ui.exec`). Scripts call them as methods (`X2World:GetWorldList()`),
  so the first argument is the table. `ADDON` is the same table as `X2` in the client.
  aa-ui already provides the UI-side parts: `X2Locale:GetLocale()`, the `ADDON` content
  registry (`RegisterContentWidget`, `GetContent`, `RegisterContentTriggerFunc`,
  `ShowContent`, `ToggleContent`) and the `X2DialogManager` message boxes (`SetHandler`,
  `RequestDefaultDialog`, `RequestNoticeDialog`, `OnOK`, `OnCancel`, `DeleteByOwnerWindow`;
  the step 3 confirm dialog matches `real_confirm_dialog.png` to a mean error of 2 of 255).
  `X2Locale:LocalizeUiText(category, key)` returns the key until the app installs the game's
  UI text table (the fake reads `ui_texts` from the game database).
  `examples/fake/fake_game.lua` is a complete fake of what the login stages call, a good map of
  what the app has to provide; `docs/ui-api.md` (aa-lua) lists every call site.
* `fire_event(name, args)` / `queue_event(name, args)` raise UI events (`args` is anything
  `IntoLuaMulti`: `()`, `true`, `("a", 1)`).
* `key(&UiKey)` / `type_text(&str)` / `focus()` / `set_focus(id)`: keyboard (the plugin already
  forwards Bevy's `KeyboardInput`). `UiStats::keyboard_focus` tells the app an edit box has the
  keys, so it should skip its key bindings.
* `UiVirtualPointer { pos, press, release }`: drive the mouse from code (tests, automation).
* `exec(name, code)`, `dump_json()`, `stub_calls()`, `errors`: debugging.

## Adding a widget type

1. The class and its exact method list: `lua/classes.rs` is generated from
   `reference/api/widget_methods.json` by `data/extract/aa-ui/tools/genclasses.py`. A class the
   capture could not name goes into `EXTRA_CLASSES` (`lua/mod.rs`); it gets our natives plus
   stubs for every known method name.
2. The type: `tree::WidgetType::parse` maps the `CreateWidget` type string; add a variant if
   the type needs native state, and decide `has_text` (gets a text block and `style`) and
   `mouse_native` (takes the mouse without handlers).
3. State: a `pub struct XData` in its own module (`lua/folder.rs`, `lua/tab.rs` and
   `lua/edit.rs` are small examples) and an `Option<XData>` field on `tree::Widget`.
4. Natives: `pub(crate) fn methods(lua, &Table)` in the module, defining each method with
   `method(lua, |lua, id, args| ...)` (`args.f(i)`, `args.s(i)`, `args.b(i, default)`; index 1
   is the first argument after `self`), returning `ret(lua, value)` or `none()`. Hook it into
   `widget::methods` under `if ty == "x"`. Methods defined later override earlier ones;
   `stubs::finalize` then adds stubs for the rest of the class list and drops anything the
   class does not have.
5. Behaviour: layout that depends on children goes into `tick` (see `tab::relayout_all`: only
   write anchors that changed, so a static screen does not rebuild), mouse behaviour into
   `input::click`, drawing into `render::build_quads`. Fire handlers through
   `ui(lua).pending.push((id, "OnX".into(), args))` inside natives, `call_handler` outside.
6. Check it: a test in `tests/natives.rs` (no window needed), then a reference capture with
   `--dump` and `cmp_tree.py`.

## Native behaviours from the aa-lua handover

| behaviour | where |
|---|---|
| `CreateChildWidget(type, name, index, true)` stores the child on the parent | `widget::create_child` |
| widgets carry `style` (and windows `titleStyle`) text style objects | `widget.rs` style methods |
| `AddTab` / `AddSimpleTab` create `window[i]`, `selectedButton[i]`, `unselectedButton[i]` | `lua/tab.rs` |
| `InsertColumn` / `InsertRows` create `column[i]` and `items[i].subItems[j]` | `widget::listctrl_methods` |
| `ADDON:GetContent(id)` is nil for unregistered ids (and the widget for registered ones) | `globals.rs` (`TOOLKIT_LUA`) |
| natives return real numbers (no proxies) | all natives |
| `X2Locale:GetLocale()` returns `"en_us"` (the configured locale) | `globals.rs` |

mlua's `send` feature is not needed: the runtime is a non-send resource and errors are
converted with `.map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("{e}"))`.

## Known differences

* Tone: the real screenshots have a global tone curve (highlights compressed, 244 -> 219,
  200 -> 193, 72 -> 55) and are darker in the middle of the screen than our render; probably a
  post effect of the login stage's 3D scene or the gamma setting, not a UI element (not found in
  the scripts). The login background sits 1 px higher than in the capture.
* 3D is not drawn: the character model view, the login stage scene behind the UI.
* Fades and animations are simplified: `Show(visible, ms)` alpha fades work; `SetStartAnimation`,
  `SetAlphaAnimation`, `SetScaleAnimation` and effect drawables are no-ops.
* Edit boxes: no text selection, clipboard, IME composition, or horizontal scrolling of long
  text; history lines are stubs. No capture shows a focused edit box, so the caret (a 1 px bar,
  `SetCursorHeight` read as extra height, `SetCursorOffset` as an x offset) is a guess.
* Game tooltips (item / skill tooltips on hover) run without script errors but their section
  natives (`AttachUpperSpaceLine`, icon sections, ...) are stubs, so they lay out roughly and
  without a background.
* Many natives are stubs (table below): mostly in-game widgets (grid, slot, model view, chat
  window, road map) and rarely used setters.

## API coverage

Per native class: methods implemented natively (including deliberate no-ops such as sounds and
animations), methods present as logging stubs, and the client's total. Generated with
`--coverage`.

| class | native | stub | listed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `button` | 84 | 44 | 128 |
| `chatwindow` | 63 | 62 | 125 |
| `checkbutton` | 88 | 44 | 132 |
| `circlediagram` | 71 | 31 | 102 |
| `cooldownactionbutton` | 84 | 48 | 132 |
| `cooldownbutton` | 84 | 47 | 131 |
| `cooldownconstantbutton` | 84 | 49 | 133 |
| `cooldowninventorybutton` | 84 | 50 | 134 |
| `damagedisplay` | 65 | 35 | 100 |
| `drawable:color` | 15 | 9 | 24 |
| `drawable:effect` | 17 | 31 | 48 |
| `drawable:iconimage` | 20 | 9 | 29 |
| `drawable:image` | 23 | 14 | 37 |
| `drawable:ninepart` | 18 | 10 | 28 |
| `drawable:text` | 16 | 13 | 29 |
| `drawable:threepart` | 18 | 9 | 27 |
| `editbox` | 83 | 36 | 119 |
| `editboxmultiline` | 73 | 34 | 107 |
| `emptywidget` | 63 | 30 | 93 |
| `folder` | 79 | 35 | 114 |
| `gametooltip` | 70 | 37 | 107 |
| `grid` | 63 | 85 | 148 |
| `label` | 68 | 30 | 98 |
| `listbox` | 66 | 72 | 138 |
| `listctrl` | 76 | 33 | 109 |
| `message` | 65 | 54 | 119 |
| `modelview` | 63 | 96 | 159 |
| `paintcolorpicker` | 103 | 1938 | 2041 |
| `roadmap` | 63 | 77 | 140 |
| `slider` | 78 | 31 | 109 |
| `slot` | 64 | 42 | 106 |
| `statusbar` | 63 | 39 | 102 |
| `tab` | 76 | 30 | 106 |
| `textbox` | 70 | 34 | 104 |
| `uiparent` | 20 | 15 | 35 |
| `webbrowser` | 67 | 58 | 125 |
| `window` | 71 | 44 | 115 |

`paintcolorpicker` is not in the capture's class list, so it gets our natives plus a stub for
every method name any class has. Toolkit stubs the login screens still call (with the fake game
API): `listbox` item colours (`SetDefaultItemTextColor`, `SetOveredItemColor`, ...),
`message:SetMaxLines` / `SetTimeVisible`, `emptywidget:EnableScroll` /
`ChangeChildAnchorByScrollValue`, `drawable:image:SetAnimFrameInfo` (frame animations),
`button:IgnoreInputOnFading`, and the `gametooltip` section natives when a tooltip shows.
